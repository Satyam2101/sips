Preparation
install pybind11, cmake, openmp, python
install finufft(python package)

How to build the library?
a) cd sips
b) mkdir build & cd build
c) conda activate <env> 
   (make sure the python version is consistent during building and running,
    inconsistency may trigger "module not found" error)
d) cmake ..
e) cmake --build .

How to run the examples?
a) cd scripts
b) python run.py ./examples/pairwise_sgd
(the directory should contain the input file info.json,
 you may modify the info.json as you need)

How to build and run the C++ gtests?(for testing only)
a) cd sips/cpptests/source & mkdir build
b) cmake ..
c) cmake --build . 
d) ./test_main --gtest_filter=SIP*

What are we simulating? 
we are simulating dynamical equations for partilce systems, to be more specific
a)

structure of the C++ code(sips)
1) biased random orgainization 
2) stochastic gradient descent for particles 
3) stochastic process with multiplicative noise 

folders
--include:
----algorigms:
    base_algorithms.hpp
    bro_algorithms.hpp
        1) BRO with particle-wise kick
        2) BRO with reciprocal, pairwise kick
        3) BRO with nonreciprocal, pairwise kick (*likely to be Sam's method)
    sgd_algorithms.hpp
        1) SGD with selective, pairwise batch
        2) SGD with probablistic, pairwise batch
        3) SGD with selective, particlewise batch
        4) SGD with probablistic, particlewise batch
    stocastic_algotithms.hpp
        1) particlewise stochastic dynamics
        2) pairwise stochastic dynamics
----hyperalg:
        hyperalg classes
----sips:
        stocastical-force(kicks) classes based on hyperalg classes
----potentials:
        inversepower.hpp
----src:
        py_wrapper.cpp 
        (use pybind11 to wrap the algorithm classes)

----scratch:
    scratch.cpp
        Description: use the stcratch and test some simple functions
                     !!! do not use add_directories() to include this directory
                         in the project cmake file. It is just a scratch.

*SIPS project is based on hyperalg potentials, at the same time, keeping the hyerperalg 
as untouched as possible.
*nolhmann json hearder(https://github.com/nlohmann/json) is applied for processing json files. 
it is compatible with C++11 and C++14 standard, sometimes not work well with C++17(also depends on 
the compilor).
